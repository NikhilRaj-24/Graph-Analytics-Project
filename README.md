# Global Terrorism Analysis

## Overview

The Global Terrorism Database (GTD) is a comprehensive dataset that records acts of terrorism worldwide. I analyzed the GTD to identify the countries most affected by terrorism and to explore the network of relationships among these countries. Using network analysis, I measured various centrality measures, including degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality, to understand the importance of each country in the global terrorism network.
